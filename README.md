## BM1366
- The BM1366 is a undocumented SHA256 mining ASIC from Bitmain. It's used in the Antminer S19XP and the S19k Pro
- Bitmain claims the BM1366 has 0.021J/GH efficiency
- The BM1366 is available (new) for around $15 each in small quantities.
- The BM1366 has a different footprint and pinout from the BM1397 and BM1387 in previous bitaxe.
- The BM1366 appears to roll more than just the nonce on the chip. This is great news, because it allows much longer serial chains of ASICs and new work doesn't need to be sent as often.
